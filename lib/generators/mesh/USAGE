Description:
    The Mesh generator combines application renaming and deployment setup into a single,
    unified command. It renames your Rails application from "keystone_base" to your
    chosen name and sets up Kamal deployment with 1Password integration.

Example:
    bin/rails generate mesh my_awesome_app

    This will:
    1. Rename the application from "keystone_base" to "my_awesome_app"
    2. Update all relevant files (config/application.rb, PWA manifest, Dockerfile, etc.)
    3. Set up Kamal deployment configuration
    4. Configure 1Password integration for secrets management
    5. Create a new 1Password vault item named "my_awesome_app"

    - Renames application module in config/application.rb
    - Updates service name, image name, and volume names in deployment files
    - Updates PWA manifest with new application name
    - Updates Dockerfile comments
    - Generates Kamal deployment configuration (config/deploy.yml)
    - Generates Kamal secrets file (.kamal/secrets)
    - Creates 1Password vault item with all environment variables and secrets
